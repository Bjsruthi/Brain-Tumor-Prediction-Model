# Brain Tumor Prediction Using VGG19 and Tkinter GUI

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model based on the pre-trained VGG19 architecture to classify brain MRI scans into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary tumor, and No Tumor. It integrates the model into a user-friendly Python Tkinter GUI, enabling users to upload MRI images and get real-time tumor classification results. The application aims to assist medical professionals by providing a quick and accurate brain tumor detection tool.

## Features
- Fine-tuned VGG19 model for brain tumor classification  
- Classifies MRI images into four categories: Glioma, Meningioma, Pituitary tumor, and No Tumor  
- Interactive Tkinter GUI for uploading images and viewing predictions  
- Displays classification results instantly  
- Future plans: adding more tumor types and drag-and-drop image upload support

## Technologies Used
- Python  
- TensorFlow / Keras  
- Tkinter (GUI framework)  
- OpenCV (for image processing)  
- NumPy and Pandas
